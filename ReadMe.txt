Hi! 

I am so sorry I was just looking at the Assignment grades that have been input, and I realized I never submitted my Assignment 6 which is truly mortifying on my part. 

I am going to blame of the quarter burn out, but this is truly just egregiously late. 

Anyways, I hope y'all have a nice weekend and a good wrap up of the quarter!

Warmly,

Abby B
